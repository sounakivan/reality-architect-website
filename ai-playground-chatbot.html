  <p class="project-intro">An interactive narrative experiment that uses GPT to create branching stories that adapt to your choices. Each decision shapes the narrative, creating a unique experience every time.</p>
  
  <div class="api-note">
    <strong>📝 What I Explored:</strong> This experiment explores how LLMs can power dynamic storytelling that responds to player agency. By carefully crafting system prompts and maintaining narrative context, I created a story engine that feels responsive and coherent.
    <br><br>
    <strong>🎯 What I Learned:</strong> Prompt engineering is crucial for narrative consistency. I learned to balance creative freedom with narrative constraints, and how to maintain character voices and story arcs across multiple LLM calls.

  <h2>About This Demo</h2>
  <p>This is a demonstration of narrative branching using client-side JavaScript. In a production version, this would connect to GPT-4 or Claude APIs to generate truly dynamic narratives based on player choices.</p>
  
  <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Prompt Design:</strong> System prompts establish narrative voice, genre conventions, and pacing</li>
    <li><strong>Context Management:</strong> Story history is maintained to ensure consistency</li>
    <li><strong>Choice Generation:</strong> The AI generates meaningful choices that respect player agency</li>
    <li><strong>Narrative Coherence:</strong> Constraints ensure the story remains compelling and logical</li>

# Reality Architect ‚Äî Portfolio

A responsive, interactive portfolio site for **Sounak Ghosh**, themed ‚ÄúReality Architect,‚Äù featuring a subtle Three.js 3D background and smooth, modern UI.

## Structure
- `index.html` ‚Äî Homepage with **Home**, **Skills**, **Projects**, **Contact** sections
- `project-*.html` ‚Äî Individual project pages
- `styles.css` ‚Äî Theme and responsive layout
- `script.js` ‚Äî 3D background (Three.js) + card tilt interactions
- `thanks.html` ‚Äî Post‚Äësubmission page for contact form

## Contact Form
This project uses **FormSubmit** to route form submissions to your email:
- Action: `https://formsubmit.co/sounaktheghosh@gmail.com`
- On first submission, FormSubmit will send a verification email. Approve it once to activate. (Free tier is fine.)

If you prefer EmailJS or your own backend, swap the form `action` and add your script as needed.

## Run Locally
Just open `index.html` in a browser. For live reload:
```bash
python -m http.server 7777
# then visit http://localhost:7777
```

## Publish on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new repo named, for example, `reality-architect-portfolio`.
2. Add these files and commit:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit ‚Äî Reality Architect portfolio"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/reality-architect-portfolio.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
3. In GitHub, go to **Settings ‚Üí Pages**:
   - **Source**: select **Deploy from a branch**
   - **Branch**: choose **main** and **/root**
   - Save. Pages will build and give you a public URL in a minute.
4. (Optional) Add a custom domain under **Settings ‚Üí Pages**.
5. Test the contact form once live to complete FormSubmit‚Äôs one‚Äëtime verification.

## Customization
- Colors and glow: edit CSS `:root` variables.
- Particle look: tweak `num`, size, and spread in `script.js`.
- Add logos, screenshots: drop assets in `/assets` and reference them in the HTML.

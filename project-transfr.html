  <h1 class="project-title">Transfr - XR Design & Systems</h1>
  
  <p class="project-intro">At Transfr, I helped shape the future of learning by building immersive Virtual Reality simulations that empower people to explore careers, gain practical skills, and unlock new opportunities. My work cut across product design, systems engineering, and AI-driven workflows—always with the goal of making VR education scalable, efficient, and impactful.</p>

  <p>Here's a few of the simulations I have built:</p>

  <h2>Building VR Training & Career Exploration Simulations</h2>
  
  <p>I contributed to two distinct product lines at Transfr:</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Hands-on Training Simulations</strong> – realistic, interactive modules where learners practice job-ready skills in safe, virtual environments.</li>
    <li><strong>Career Exploration Simulations</strong> – immersive experiences that let learners "step into" different professions, understand roles, and discover pathways to meaningful work.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Each simulation I built balanced technical precision with instructional design, ensuring experiences weren't just engaging, but also pedagogically effective.</p>

  <h2>Designing & Prototyping with Proprietary SDK Tools</h2>
  
  <p>Transfr's innovation depended on tools that could keep pace with ambitious ideas. I played a key role in designing, testing, and prototyping with our proprietary SDK tools, which powered the development of new simulations.</p>

  <p>One of my most impactful contributions was helping develop a node-based editor for Unity simulation development—a visual scripting environment that dramatically streamlined production. This editor empowered both designers and developers to build complex interactions quickly, while maintaining consistency and scalability across the product ecosystem.</p>

  <h2>Creating Modular XR Frameworks & Systems</h2>
  
  <p>To keep simulations consistent, modular, and instructional by design, I created frameworks and processes that embedded instructional UX patterns into every experience.</p>
  
  <p>These systems:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Standardized XR interactions across dozens of simulations.</li>
    <li>Ensured modules could be reused and reconfigured for different industries and training contexts.</li>
    <li>Reduced production friction, allowing studios and designers to build faster without reinventing the wheel.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>In short, I helped turn VR training from a collection of one-off projects into a scalable simulation ecosystem.</p>

  <h2>Automating with AI Workflows</h2>
  
  <p>Beyond simulation design, I built AI-powered automation pipelines that accelerated production and unlocked new capabilities. Using tools like n8n, I developed workflows for:</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Asset retrieval</strong> – quickly sourcing and categorizing 3D assets.</li>
    <li><strong>Script generation</strong> – converting raw instructional content into coach-ready dialogue.</li>
    <li><strong>Document conversion & data handling</strong> – ensuring knowledge could flow smoothly across formats.</li>
    <li><strong>Agentic bots</strong> – intelligent assistants that reduced manual overhead for production teams.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>These AI workflows turned repetitive bottlenecks into automated processes, freeing teams to focus on creativity and innovation.</p>

  <h2>Impact</h2>
  
  <p>My 3 years at Transfr has been about architecting systems, not just simulations. From VR career exploration experiences to AI automation pipelines, I helped create the tools, frameworks, and workflows that made scalable VR education possible.</p>
